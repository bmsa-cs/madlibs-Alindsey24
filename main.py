As I look around the {place} I begin to wonder why no one has their {noun2}s out.\n Are we doing something {adj} today? No more {noun3} {verb2} and {verb3}? I can't wait! I took my {noun4} and {verb4}.\n {number} {lenti}s passed. Where is {name}? One of my friends looked over and {volspeak}ed, \"I think he's in the {place2}.\"\n Okay, I thought to myself. Why did that need to be {volspeak}ed? I told my friend to {verb5}. Please. Again, I began to {verb6} for {name} to come back.\n Wait! Someone new entered the {place}. Who's that? \"That's {name2}\" {name3} {volspeak2} from behind me. \"They're {adj3}!\" If they're so {adj3} then why don't they look like it? To be honest, they look like a {noun5}. They're probably just here to {verb7} to us.")
